<HTML><BODY>Travels to the ruins of Zimbabwe (long before it became the name of the country), complete with some speculations about these being the mythical source of gold of the queen of Sheba.

<p>I am planning to use both the <a href="https://archive.org/details/ruinedcitiesofma00bent">1892 1st ed</a> (which includes maps) and the <a href="https://archive.org/details/ruinedcitiesofma00bentiala/page/n10">1895 3rd ed</a> (which includes additional text and illustrations) to prepare a PG version (using the text and illustrations of the third, and adding in the maps of the first edition).

</p><p>A few words in Greek, numerous uncommon words and names, but nothing that makes this work hard, so have fun!
